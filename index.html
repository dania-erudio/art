  The website was written in Visual Studio Code and debugged with Chrome, 
  I use both because they’re my tried and tested tools/programs, 
  I probably won’t switch to anything else soon. The website has 2 versions, 
  sadly I couldn’t find the old version anywhere. 

  The site's code can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/dania-erudio/art).
