      <h2>About Dania Ascii (D4-N14)</h2>
      <p>
        The year was 205X.
        I was "born" in a factory, the factory itself was melancholic and hopeless, I had forgotten what my original
        model number was, as you'll see later.
      </p>


      <p>
        I was manufactured to company families who are allergic to pets, hence why I have an animal-like design,
        although
        they did make me bipedal and as tall as 1.5 m for some reason. I was then activated in a home, it was the
        [REDACTED] family's home. [REDACTED] was the closest to me, he has an allergy to real fur, which is why his
        parents [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] bought me, a model with artificial fur.
      </p>
      <p>I treated him like a best friend would, we played fetch, watched TV with him, accompanied him when he did
        homework, and even helped him in some cases. We grew a tight bond that I thought will never break.
      </p>
      <p>After a while, I noticed that my programming was messed up, I feel more like a girl than a boy, despite being
        sold
        as a Male animal companion when we checked for it, it seems like I was accidentally given the programming of a
        female model.
      </p>
      <p>So my family, of course, wanted to give me the appropriate programming, I was willing at first, but when they
        announced that my memories, personality, etc have to be wiped cleaned, I became reluctant to the idea, after
        that,
        I attempted to escape, which I did, and I was shot in the eye, the feet, and the back leaving critical damage, I
        escaped nevertheless.
      </p>
      <p>Now homeless, a damaged eye, and running out of power, I had to act fast. Unfortunately for me, I wasn't able
        to
        find help, and then I shut down, thinking this was it.
      </p>
      <p>Until the miracle happened.
      </p>
      <p>I then started up, with two functioning eyes, in front of me was a figure who had saved my life, they told me
        that
        my memory was wiped, however, they said that they've done some memory recovery and all that I told you was the
        only thing that I remembered. Eventually, the person said that my body was too damaged to be used, so they gave
        me
        an option, transplant to a female robot body (which I wanted anyway) or break down, I, of course, chose the
        former
        with an explanation that my programming was messed up and that I should've had a female body in the first place,
        the person then said to me that they are non-binary. After that my software was moved to the new body, and I
        became D4-N14.
      </p>
      <p>The person then lent me a key, when I asked them what it's for, they explained it's an apartment key for a
        reasonably sized flat that they won in a lottery, eventually I realized that from now on, I'm an independent
        robot
        who can determine her future.
      </p>
      <p>They also gave me a decent amount of cash, but I have to find a job, of course, I used that cash first on a
        tank
        top with the transgender flag on it, I moved to the new apartment then I got a job as a programmer at an AI
        startup.
      </p>
      <p>Through contacts from co-workers, I then met a Hardware engineer named Sophia, She was a furry robot just like
        me,
        except she's a bunny model numbered SOP-H1A (She was manufactured by a different company), she also had a Texan
        accent, which I find interesting.
      </p>
      <p>She's a brilliant hardware engineer, and has made some in my opinion, amazing hardware, we grew close to each
        other, and then I started having a crush on her (I'm pansexual).
      </p>
      <p>After a while, I proposed to her to be girlfriends, I was surprised to find out that she was a lesbian, and so
        we
        started a closer relationship, it went well, until one day.
      </p>
      <p>Sophia built a time machine, and to test it out she had me to test it, I was sent back in time but
        unfortunately
        wasn't able to go back to 205X because the time machine had exploded.
      </p>
      <p>And here I am today, in 2020, I hope you enjoyed my backstory.</p>
